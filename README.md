# mlkit_vision

This library is a fork of `firebase_ml_vision`, it uses the newer Google `mlkit` native apis to perform vision operations.
The on device apis from firebase ml_vision are deprecated and cause build errors with newer versions of other firebase products.


## Getting Started

ONLY BARCODE SCANNING WORKS AS OF NOW, please feel free to fork and add support for other vision apis.
